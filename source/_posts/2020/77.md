耳边响起的是14路喜欢的吉他声，眼前是我所喜欢的歌词，很平静、很简单的一些单词，脑海里更是隐隐约约有一人在微笑，这种微笑像是《音乐之声》里船长歌唱《Edelweiss》的微笑，也像是卡百利《Dying In The Sun》的舞蹈，很诱人，充满魔力。  
  
每个人都有每个人的内心，这一世界的丰富与精彩，又有几人能够体会，当然，这一世界的生活也无须其他人来感受与体验，而当你不幸走入这样子一个境地，你会乐此不疲，乐不思蜀。  
  
一遍遍地体验着李敖说的“快乐得要死”！  
  
铿锵有力的五个字！你认为呢？  
  
  
《When i see you smile 》  
词/曲:bic roung  
when i see you smile / it feels like i'm falling  
it's not for anybody else to know  
the way your face could light / the bitter dark of every street  
in every town i'll ever go / it's not for anybody else to know  
for anybody else to know/when i see you smile/first thing in the morning  
it raises curtains on your lazy eyes / could it be that you and i  
have the greatest love to ever be how could this have ever been before  
it's not for anybody else to know / for anybody else to know  
when friday night arrives / we'll let it pass outside the door  
this is not for anybody else / anybody else to know
