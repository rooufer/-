**SAY BYEBYE!**

  
  
落幕一定在带些伤感的话，我宁愿多遗留些回忆。  
  
6：4只是个结果，并不是啥结局，结局谁又可能会猜得出，把看球变成一种习惯，把进球当作一种刺激，与球员同醉，与球场气氛同浓，与20亿球迷同乐，与自己作为一名自始至终的伪球迷同幸。  
  
之后，回家的回家，庆祝的庆祝，悲伤的悲伤，各自重新回到自己的位置，生活即将恢复平静。  
足球总能让我看到艺术，又想起战争,想起亚历山大。  
  
印象深刻的亚历山大帝，那种场面终其一生也难忘。命运之神是要眷顾无畏的人，他的失败比任何人的成功都要有成就，在喜马拉雅山那句：we are go home！既令人心碎，又使人著迷，一代浩瀚君王，终究孤独的面对死亡，世界难免会表现出这种凄美。  
  
回家，包含多少情感，以至无奈呀。  
  
Let me say byebye,and sing ‘Yesterday once more’.  
  
  
  
**Yesterday once more**  
  
When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waiting for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along,  
It make me smile.  
  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone.  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I love so well.  
Every shalala every wo'wo  
still shines.  
  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing  
so fine  
  
When they get to the part  
where he's breaking her heart  
It can really make me cry  
just like before.  
It's yesterday once more.  
(Shoobie do lang lang)  
Looking bak on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that had  
makes today seem rather sad,  
So much has changed.  
  
It was songs of love that I would sing to them  
And I'd memorise each word.  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
Every shalala every wo'wo still shines  
  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startingTo sing  
so fine  
All my best memorise come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry  
just like before.  
It's yesterday once more.  
(Shoobie do lang lang)  
Every shalala every wo'wo still shines.  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing  
so fine  
Every shalala every wo'wo still shines.  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing  
so fine
