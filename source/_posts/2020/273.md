**渴望改变是一种积极的等待，因为你就是我的世界！  
Rooufer**  
  
再怎么掩饰，也无法掩盖内心的骚动，也许这便是年少轻狂，更何况一个不会掩饰的人，平淡，刻板的生活让我觉得要有些改变才好，例行事宜真是无聊，时时找不到 兴奋点，是该好好刺激一下的时刻，Waiting on the world to change，是呀，你就是我的世界，渴望改变就是我对你的依恋。  
  
  
《Waiting on the World to Change》  
John Mayer's Continuum  
Me and all my friends / We're all misunderstood / They say we stand for nothing / There's no way we ever could / Now we see everything is going wrong / With the world and those who lead it / We just feel like we don't have the means / To rise above and beat it / So we keep waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / We keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / Its hard to be persistant / When we're standing at a distance / So we keep waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / Now if we had the power / To bring our neighbors home from war / They would've never missed a Christmas / No more ribbons on their door / When you trust your television / What you get is what you got / Cuz when they own the information ooohhh, / They can bend it all they want / So while we're waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / We keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / It's not that we don't care / We just know that the fight ain't fair / So we keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / We're still waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / We keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / One day our generation / Is gonna rule the population / So we keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / Know we keep on waiting (waiting) / Waiting on the world to change / We keep on waiting (waiting)
