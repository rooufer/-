尘埃落定  
  
今天非常荣幸地看到了一个叫“七七”的博客，当然，我也很认真地读了他的文字，实实在在的是念念有词的读出来，他的文字很适合读，散文形式，温和中带些坚毅，读起来很清爽。  
  
因 为是第一次见到“七七”，当然很多事情不敢说，从读到的文字而言，忍不住让我想说几句，文笔相当的好，感情也非常的真，深深地爱过，也深深地痛过。“七 七”喜欢幻想，喜欢发呆，喜欢夜晚，喜欢床垫，尽管故作坚强，依然没有摆脱那些圈圈的束缚。比如说信缘、信命，我想，我们什么都可以信，但真正的信是什么 都不信。太过信缘容易宿命，太过信命容易悲观。因此，“七七”的文字多少带些凄美。即爱且恨，又不太清楚何为爱何为恨。总之，是一种非常复杂的心境，却正 是这种复杂与矛盾，“七七”的文字才有了生命，有了真实的存在。  
  
没事的时候读读“七七”，像是在读自己，很近很像！  
  
  
blowing in the wind 尘埃落定  
How many roads must a man walk down / Before they call him a manHow many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sandHow many times must the cannon balls fly / Before they're forever bannedThe answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind / The answer is blowing in the windHow many years must a mountain exist / Before it is washed to the seaHow many years can some people exist / Before they're allowed to be freeHow many times can a man turn his head / And pretend that he just doesn't seeThe answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind / The answer is blowing in the windHow many times must a man look up / Before he can see the skyHow many ears must one man have / Before he can hear people cryHow many deaths will it take / 'Till he knows that too many people have diedThe answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind / The answer is blowing in the wind
