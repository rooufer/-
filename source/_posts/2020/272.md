《slow dancing in a burning room》  
john mayer  
It's not a silly little moment / It's not the storm before the calm / This is the deep and dyin breath of / This love we've been workin on / Can't seem to hold you like I want to / So I can feel you in my arms / Nobody's gonna come and save you / We pulled too many false alarms / We're goin down / And you can see it too / We're goin down / And you know that we're doomed / My dear / We're slow dancing in a burnin room / I was the one you always dreamed of / You were the one I tried to draw / How dare you say it's nothing to me / Baby, you're the only light I ever saw / I'll make the most of all the sadness / You'll be a bitch because you can / You try to hit me just hurt me / So you leave me feeling dirty / Because you can't understand / We're goin down / And you can see it too / We're goin down / And you know that we're doomed / My dear / We're slow dancing in a burnin room / Go cry about it why don't you / Go cry about it why don't you / Go cry about it why don't you / My dear, we're slow dancin' in a burnin' room / Burninl room, burnin' room / Don't you think we oughta know by now / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we oughta know by now / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we oughta know by now / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow / Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow
