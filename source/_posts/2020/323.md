静得出奇的图书馆很适合于看小说，也很适合于编织小说，任思绪在无际涯的精神世界里徜徉。  
小说有两个主人公，男主人公23岁，没有女朋友，女主人公25岁，没有男朋友，男主人公喜欢衷情于蓝色，女主人公的著装与眼神总会带些蓝色的调调。  
  
中午时分，男女主人公出现在相约的那棵大松树下，那是他俩第一次非正式约会，其理由还是为了寻找各自的房子。女主人公李宁牌运动鞋，深蓝色Adidas运动 裤，两侧四条白丝线，浅咖啡色外套，往右斜挎着百事白蓝红三色包，两只手躲在包后的裤袋，包里两根黑丝线延伸至耳廓，她在随意的听着音乐，身体伴随着音乐 左右晃动着，像是冷静地在等着奇迹的出现。  
  
约摸二十三分钟后，男主人公出现了，这等待的时辰与男主人公的年龄正好相仿，他著红白蓝三色跑 鞋，海盗裤，黑外套，还有刚理完一半的头发，他看起来甚为幽默，却又像是一种矛盾着的和谐存在，他来见女主人公就像是松树的呼唤，因为她看似轻松随意，难 掩尊贵典雅，而他看似绅士气度，实则孩子气十足，好一幅“青松唤童来见图”。  
  
他俩的首次见面没有过分夸张，没有些许紧张，男主人公只说了 简单一句：嗨，走吧！便开始了小说里的演绎，他俩边走边聊，像是老朋友，像是旧相识，不用寒喧便直接谈论起上次未完的话题，这其实已经令男主人公开始迷惑 了，因为他向来不善于在喜欢的女孩子面前能保持镇定，他喜怒于色，他无遮无掩，女主人公的尊贵气质，缕缕飘浮在他身侧，以至于他的不成熟瞬间化为泡影，他 一下子长大了十岁，他习惯于仰着头看女孩子的方式也改为了正视，此刻，女主人公的发、额、眉、目、耳、鼻、颊、唇，每一部分都精准地烙入男主人公的心灵， 那是一个蓝色的世界，Blue，blue & blue。  
  
微风拂面，女主人公秀发摇曳，与她听的音乐，说的话语相映呈现，男主人公一旁伴着她，听着她，看着她，偶尔说些话，但那些都不是重要的，重要的是她在说话，她在他身边，这就已经足够了，他俩没有牵手，但一同朝蓝色的梦幻走去，愈来愈模糊，愈来愈融为一体……  
  
  
《Daily Growing》  
ALTAN - The Blue Idol  
The trees they grow high / the leaves they do grow green / Many is the time my true love I've seen / Many an hour I have watched him all alone / He's young but he's daily growing / Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong / You have married me to a boy who is too young / I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen / He's young but he's daily growing / Daughter, dear daughter / I've done you no wrong / I have married you to a great lord's son / He will be a man for you when I am dead and gone / He's young but he's daily growing / Father, dear father / if you see fit / We'll send him to college for another year yet / I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head / To let the maidens know that he is married / One day I was looking over my father's castle wall / I spied all the boys playing with a ball / And my own true love was the flower of them all / He's young but he's daily growing / And so early in the morning at the dawning of the day / They went into a hayfield to have some sport and play / And what they did there she never would declare / But she never more complained of his growing At the age of fourteen he was a married man / At the age of fifteen the father of my son / At the age of sixteen his grave it was green / And death had put an end to his growing / I'll buy my love some flannel / I'll make my love a shroud / With every stitch I put in it / the tears they will pour down / With every stitch I put in it / how the tears they will flow / Cruel fate has put an end to his growing.
