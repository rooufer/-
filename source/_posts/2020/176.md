《Bizarre Love Triangle》  
Singer:Frente  
Every time i think of you / I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue  
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem i find  
Living a life that i can't leave behind / There's no sense in telling me  
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free / But that's the way that it goes  
And it's what nobody knows / GreenWatch  
And every day my confusion grows  
Every time i see you falling / I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment / You'll say the words that i can't say  
I feel fine and i feel good /I feel like i never should  
Whenever i get this way /i just don't know what to say  
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday /GreenWatch  
I'm not sure what this could mean /I don't think you're what you seem  
I do admit to myself / That if i hurt someone else  
Then we'd never see just what we're meant to be  
Every time i see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray /I'm waiting for that final moment  
You'll say the words that i can't say  
  
  
《Under southern skies》  
Singer:Nikki Webster  
there's a peace in our hearts / and a hope in our hands  
we're a family of children / we come from many different lands  
our time is just beginning / our race is yet to run  
but if you will take us with you / then we have already won  
under the southern skies / together in this land  
every voice in celebration / a family hand in hand  
under the southern skies / as one we rise  
and turn our eyes to see / all the wonder of the future  
in a world of harmony / there's a great spirit rising  
from the desert to the sea / as it sweeps across this southern land  
it calls to you and me / where the dreamers are the dreaming  
we're the fates of things yet to come / every child can be a hero  
if our world could live as one
