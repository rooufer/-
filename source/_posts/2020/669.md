**《黑暗中的舞者》  
唱：比约克**  
……  
**莎曼：**火车来了，离开路轨，谢夫！  
你得小心，避在一旁。  
**谢夫：**你看不到吧，对吗？  
**莎曼：**有什么好看的？  
我什么都见过了，见过树木。  
见过杨柳在微风中起舞。  
见过一个人补他最好的朋友杀害。  
见过还未活过就已结束的生命。  
我见过我是谁，知道我将如何？  
我什么都见过了，无须再看什么。  
**谢夫：**你没见过大象、帝王和秘鲁？  
**莎曼：**我乐于告诉你我有更好的事可做。  
**谢夫：**那么中国呢？你见过长城吗？  
**莎曼：**所有城墙都好看，只要屋顶不塌。  
**谢夫：**还有你嫁的男人呢？你俩的家呢？  
**莎曼：**老实说，我漠不关心。  
**谢夫：**你从来没见过尼加拉瓜瀑布吧？  
**莎曼：**我见过水，那也是水而已。  
**谢夫：**艾菲尔铁塔呢？帝国大厦呢？  
**莎曼：**我第一次约会时血压也一样高。  
**谢夫：**你孙儿把玩你头了的小手呢？  
**莎曼：**老实说，我漠不关心。  
我什么都见过了，见过黑暗。  
我见过小火花的光辉。  
我见过我想看的，我需要看的。  
那就够了，想多要就是贪心。  
我见过我是谁？知道我将如何。  
我什么都见过了，无须再看什么。  
**合唱：**你什么都见过了，你见过的一切。  
你都可在自己的不荧幕上重温。  
光明和黑暗，大与小。  
只须记著，你什么也不再需要。  
你见过你是谁？知道你将如何。  
你什么也见过了，无须再看什么。  
**谢夫：**你看不到吧，对吗？  
**莎曼：**（微笑）  
  
**i'VE SEEN iT ALL  
bjork---Dancer In The Dark**  
  
I've seen it all, I have seen the trees,  
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze  
I've seen a friend killed by a friend,  
And lives that were over before they were spent.  
I've seen what I was - I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
  
You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru!  
I'm happy to say I had better to do  
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?  
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!  
And the man you will marry?  
The home you will share?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
You've never been to Niagara Falls?  
I have seen water, its water, that's all...  
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?  
My pulse was as high on my very first date!  
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark  
I've seen the brightness in one little spark.  
I've seen what I chose and I've seen what I need,  
And that is enough, to want more would be greed.  
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
  
You've seen it all and all you have seen  
You can always review on your own little screen  
The light and the dark, the big and the small  
Just keep in mind - you need no more at all  
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be  
You've seen it all - there is no more to see!
